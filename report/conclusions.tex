\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this short paper we have played a bit with the packets which were captured in a small enterprise. Our primary goal was to analyse the
interactions of computers and build the statistics for the traffic which was captured for several hours. Our key findings are 
the following: (i) major traffic in the network is HTTPS and HTTP, (ii) antivirus solutions consume considerable amount of 
bandwidth, (iii) computers in the network mainly interact with the default gateway and few servers, such as NFS server and mail server.
